Final EDA Summary 

The exploratory data analysis conducted on the recent 2-year customer dataset, consisting of 3,210 records, provides a comprehensive understanding of the behavioral, demographic, and service-related factors influencing churn in the early stages of a customer's lifecycle. The analysis reveals that churn is concentrated primarily within customers who have a shorter tenure, particularly those in their first 6 months of service. This trend suggests that the onboarding experience, initial service quality, and first billing cycles play a critical role in shaping customer satisfaction. Customers with longer tenure (18–24 months) demonstrate significantly lower churn, indicating improved loyalty and a greater degree of service stability over time.

A detailed comparison of contract types further strengthens these insights. Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit the highest churn rates, highlighting their flexibility and lower switching barriers. In contrast, customers with one-year contracts show moderate churn, while those with two-year contracts demonstrate exceptional stability, with churn rates approaching near-zero levels. This pattern confirms the importance of long-term contracts in enhancing customer retention and reducing the likelihood of service discontinuation.

Service-category comparisons reveal additional churn drivers. Among the internet service types, fiber optic customers show the highest churn levels. This may be attributed to performance expectations, service disruptions, or customer dissatisfaction related to speed consistency. DSL users show moderate churn, while customers classified under “No internet service” consistently demonstrate low churn, likely due to fewer service dependencies. This points toward the need for focused quality improvements in fiber-based offerings to reduce early-stage churn.

Billing and payment-related factors also show strong correlations with churn behavior. Customers with higher monthly charges churn more frequently, signaling the impact of pricing pressure and perceived value on customer decisions. Payment method analysis further supports this view: customers using electronic check payments exhibit the highest churn, potentially due to payment friction or inconsistent billing experiences. In contrast, customers using automatic payment methods—such as credit card or bank transfer—have significantly higher retention, indicating that convenience and payment reliability contribute positively to customer loyalty.

Value-added services, such as Tech Support and Online Security, emerge as powerful retention indicators. Customers who do not subscribe to these add-on services show substantially higher churn. Subscribers, on the other hand, remain more stable, suggesting that additional support, protection, and bundled features increase perceived value and reduce the likelihood of churn. Furthermore, across all categories, customers listed under “No internet service” consistently display the lowest churn, reinforcing the role of service complexity in customer dissatisfaction.

Overall, the EDA findings highlight a combination of structural and behavioral churn drivers in the first two years. These include short-term contracts, higher billing amounts, lack of value-added services, reliance on manual payment methods, and service-specific dissatisfaction—particularly with fiber optic connections. Together, these insights provide a strong analytical foundation for the next phases of the project, enabling the development of predictive churn models and the formulation of targeted retention strategies tailored to high-risk customer segments.
