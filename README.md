EXECUTIVE SUMMARY/ PROJECT SYNOPSIS

Telecommunication companies operate in a highly competitive market, where keeping customers has become a key priority. With more service options, competitive pricing, and fast technological progress, customers can easily switch providers, which results in higher churn rates. 

This project, titled “Predictive Analysis on Telecom Customer Churn: A Case Study on Airtel,” aims to use data techniques to find patterns related to customer churn and create predictive models that help telecom operators retain their customers proactively. 

Airtel is one of India’s major telecom service providers, serving millions of customers nationwide. Even with a strong market presence, companies like Airtel deal with challenges like changing customer loyalty, concerns over service quality, pressure on pricing, and rising expectations for smooth digital experiences. Therefore, it is crucial to understand what drives customer churn to improve service quality, boost customer engagement, and maintain a competitive edge. 

The study analyzes historical customer data, which includes demographics, usage habits, billing details, complaint records, and network experiences, to pinpoint factors that significantly affect churn behavior. Techniques like exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical assessment, and machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, will be used to predict churn probability for individual customers. The performance of the models will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliable predictions. The results of this project will provide useful insights for Airtel. 

These insights will allow for targeted retention campaigns, personalized offers, improved customer service responses, and better resource allocation. By identifying high-risk customers accurately, Airtel can lower churn, boost customer lifetime value, and improve overall operational efficiency. The project relates closely to the MBA Information Technology specialization, as it combines analytics, machine learning, and telecom business strategy. It also reflects industry needs for data-driven decision-making to solve real business issues. The findings and methods will benefit not just Airtel but also other telecom providers and broadband businesses looking to implement predictive analytics for customer management. 





This project helps advance both academic knowledge and practical use of predictive analytics in the telecom industry while supporting future opportunities in data analytics, telecom management, and digital transformation strategies.
