EXECUTIVE SUMMARY/ PROJECT SYNOPSIS

Telecommunication companies operate in a highly competitive market, where keeping customers has become a key priority. With more service options, competitive pricing, and fast technological progress, customers can easily switch providers, which results in higher churn rates. 

This project, titled “Predictive Analysis on Telecom Customer Churn: A Case Study on Airtel,” aims to use data techniques to find patterns related to customer churn and create predictive models that help telecom operators retain their customers proactively. 

Airtel is one of India’s major telecom service providers, serving millions of customers nationwide. Even with a strong market presence, companies like Airtel deal with challenges like changing customer loyalty, concerns over service quality, pressure on pricing, and rising expectations for smooth digital experiences. Therefore, it is crucial to understand what drives customer churn to improve service quality, boost customer engagement, and maintain a competitive edge. 

The study analyzes historical customer data, which includes demographics, usage habits, billing details, complaint records, and network experiences, to pinpoint factors that significantly affect churn behavior. Techniques like exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical assessment, and machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, will be used to predict churn probability for individual customers. The performance of the models will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC to ensure reliable predictions. The results of this project will provide useful insights for Airtel. 

These insights will allow for targeted retention campaigns, personalized offers, improved customer service responses, and better resource allocation. By identifying high-risk customers accurately, Airtel can lower churn, boost customer lifetime value, and improve overall operational efficiency. The project relates closely to the MBA Information Technology specialization, as it combines analytics, machine learning, and telecom business strategy. It also reflects industry needs for data-driven decision-making to solve real business issues. The findings and methods will benefit not just Airtel but also other telecom providers and broadband businesses looking to implement predictive analytics for customer management. 





This project helps advance both academic knowledge and practical use of predictive analytics in the telecom industry while supporting future opportunities in data analytics, telecom management, and digital transformation strategies.


INTRODUCTION
COMPANY PROFILE & GENERAL INTRODUCTION OF TOPIC
& OBJECT, SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF STUDY



1.1 Company Profile

Bharti Airtel Limited (Airtel) is one of India’s largest telecommunications service providers. Established in 1995, it is currently the second-largest mobile operator in India based on subscriber count. The company serves over 375 million customers across India and operates in more than 17 countries in Asia and Africa. Airtel offers a wide range of services, including mobile voice and data, fiber broadband, DTH, enterprise connectivity, IoT solutions, cloud services, and digital platforms such as Airtel Payments Bank and Airtel Xstream.
Operating in a rapidly changing telecom environment, Airtel faces challenges such as intense competition, rising customer expectations, continuous network upgrades, and growing pressure to reduce customer churn. These factors make customer retention crucial, as fluctuations in customer satisfaction directly affect churn rates, revenue stability, and long-term market position.
Airtel’s operations are guided by key values: customer-centricity, innovation, transparency, and high performance. Its organizational structure includes dedicated divisions for network engineering, marketing, digital services, enterprise business, and customer experience, enabling efficient service delivery and technological improvement.

1.2 General Introduction of the Topic

Customer churn refers to the likelihood that customers will discontinue a service or switch to a competitor. In the telecom sector, where switching costs are low and customer expectations continue to rise, predicting churn has become essential for maintaining competitiveness and profitability. Predictive churn analysis uses statistical and machine learning techniques to study customer behavior, service usage, billing patterns, complaint history, demographics, and network experiences to assess how likely a customer is to leave.

A churn probability score is a numerical value between 0 and 1 that indicates the risk of churn for an individual customer. A higher score signals a greater likelihood of discontinuation, allowing companies to prioritize high-risk customers for targeted retention efforts.
Churn prediction is increasingly important in today’s competitive telecom market, driven by aggressive pricing, 4G/5G expansion, rising digital consumption, and evolving service expectations. Predictive analytics supports telecom operators in designing personalized retention strategies, improving service quality, enhancing customer loyalty, and optimizing operational and marketing costs.
Although predictive models provide valuable insights, they have limitations, such as dependence on data quality, potential bias in historical patterns, and reduced accuracy when customer behavior changes rapidly. These challenges highlight the need for continuous data monitoring and regular model updates.
This topic aligns closely with the MBA in Information Technology specialization, as it integrates data analytics, business intelligence, machine learning techniques, and telecom domain knowledge. It demonstrates how analytical tools support strategic decision-making and improve customer management.
